# Day 8 – Intro to n8n & Webhooks

## What I Did
1. Installed and launched n8n locally.
2. Created a “Webhook” node listening at `/webhook/log-payload`.
3. Connected it to a “Function” node that logs JSON input.
4. Sent a test request using `curl`.
5. Confirmed data was logged in the terminal.
6. Exported my workflow for documentation.
